Measurement in the social sciences is doubly difficult. Sometimes we
want to measure things that are “real” and well defined, but difficult
to count (e.g. number of homeless people). Sometimes we’re trying to
measure something that’s subjective and that doesn’t correspond to a
“thing” we can actually observe.

The following figure is commonly used to introduce the notions of
**validity** and **reliability**:

In short, a measurement is *valid* to the extent that it represents what
you are trying to measure (i.e., hitting the bull’s eye). There’s always
some kind of difference between what we can observe and what we want to
observe.

A measurement is *reliable* If we measure the same thing multiple times,
we would hope that the value doesn’t change (a lot). That is, we want
the variability in our sample too be a consequence of “real” differences
out there, and not a consequence of randomness in the measurement
process.
