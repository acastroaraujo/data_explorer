The phrase “correlation is NOT causality” has become part of popular
culture.

Suppose you’ve found a pattern or an association between two variables
*X* and *Y*. This could mean any of the following:

1.  Variable *X* causes variable *Y* (or maybe it’s the other way
    around).
2.  Both variables are unrelated and the association is an artifact of
    random sampling.
3.  The association is is due to a third unobserved variable (also known
    as a confounder).
4.  The association is an artifact of the way the data is selected. This
    also known as “conditioning on common effects” or “collider bias.”
    The important question to ask here is “Who or what gets excluded
    from our sample?” (e.g.,
    [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-statistics-dont-capture-the-full-extent-of-the-systemic-bias-in-policing/)).
    A much more advanced introduction to this topic is given by [Elwert
    & Winship
    (2014)](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043455).

There are many places to learn about causality.

-   Introductory textbooks like [*Quantitative Social
    Science*](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691175461/quantitative-social-science)
    (Imai 2018), [*Thinking Clearly With
    Data*](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691214368/thinking-clearly-with-data)
    (de Mesquita & Fowler 2021), or [*The
    Effect*](https://theeffectbook.net/) (Huntington-Klein, 2022).

-   Miguel Hernan’s online course on [*Causal
    Diagrams*](https://www.edx.org/course/causal-diagrams-draw-your-assumptions-before-your).
